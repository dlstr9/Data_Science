# This Assignment has a background case study:

HR professionals generally lag behind with respect to analytics and data
visualization competency. Thus, Dr. Carla Patalano set out to create their
own HR-related dataset, which is used in one of the graduate MSHRM
courses called HR Metrics and Analytics, at New England College of
Business. He created this data set.

# So here what i do:
1. Perform EDA on the target to find out how many feature variables
are related to the termination of an employee's employment. (Most
reasons, by department, by gender, etc.) Create data visualization
according to EDA Steps (> 5 visualizations). Give an
insight from this step.

2.  Perform Machine Learning modeling to predict employee
termination.
